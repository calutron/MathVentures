# MathVentures
Ruby  2-player guessing game 

MathVentures is a 2-player guessing game where players take turns to answer simple math expressions that are automatically generated by the game. 

Both players start with 3 lives. They lose a life if they mis-answer a question. The game doesn’t end until one of the players loses all their lives. At this point, the game announces who won and what the other player’s score is.
